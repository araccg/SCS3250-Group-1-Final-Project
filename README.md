Objective

Our objective, is to build a regression model which when fed in various statistics from the first three years of a player’s career will be able to predict that player’s highest career PER. We can then decide whether or not the player has the potential to become a star.

• Plan to train this model on data on young players from 1984 to 2006. • Test its accuracy by asking it to predict peak PER for young players from 2007 to 2012. • Validate model by comparing our predictions to the actual peak PER achieved by these players (contained in 2013-2019 data).

This is a worthwhile task because teams generally need to resign their players after their first 3-4 years. Should our model provide effective, it would provide teams with insight to decide both whether or not the player is worth signing and how much they deserve to be paid.
